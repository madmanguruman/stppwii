Collection
==========

Display - Show whether a game supports numeric input, a solver, etc.
          on the main menu, removed a couple of incorrect screen 
          updates that could make the menu flicker, game preview 
          images now centre properly (e.g. Maze3D's).

Gameplay - All games now have cursor-mode control, status-bar 
           messages now "time out" rather than linger forever.

Input - Digit input for large games that need characters rather than
        just numbers.

Memory - Can now take advantage of the upper 32Mb of RAM should we 
         ever run out of memory on the GP2X.

Screenshots - Now disabled by default, enable and press Stick-Click
              to use them.

Size - The size of the executable has been reduced by a number of
       means: removal of unused code, better final compression,
       shortening of static buffers, etc.  Also, the images have been
       compressed more using pngcrush.  This should save up to 
       500Kb on the GP2X.
